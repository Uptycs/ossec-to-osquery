# OSSEC to OSQUERY

The ossec-to-osquery project was inspired by many security practitioners 
looking for a more modern approach to host intrusion detection and a need to 
consolidate the number of agents required on a host.

The initial ideas and pioneering work, reflected in the initial submissions,
was done by:

* Matt Burdan
* John Brunn
* Doug Wilson
